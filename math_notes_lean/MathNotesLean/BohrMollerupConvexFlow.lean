# Bohr–Mollerup with convexity instead of log-convexity is **false**

This file accompanies `bohr_mollerup_convex.md`. It asks whether the Bohr–Mollerup characterization
of `Γ` survives if the hypothesis "`log ∘ f` is convex" is weakened to "`f` is convex". It does
**not**: for every `ε > 0` the function

  `fᵥ(x) = Γ(x) · (1 + ε (1 - cos 2πx))`

is a positive solution of the Gamma functional equation with `fᵥ 1 = 1`, is different from `Γ`, and
is **not** log-convex — yet (as proved analytically in the note, and confirmed numerically) it is
**convex** on `(0, ∞)` for small `ε` (e.g. `ε = 1/100`). Hence convexity alone does not single out
`Γ`.

Since `log ∨ f` convex ⟹ `f` convex (for positive `f`), convexity is a *strictly weaker* hypothesis,
so this is exactly the expected failure. Concretely we prove here, sorry-free:

* `perturb` is `1`-periodic, positive, and equals `1` at `x = 1` (so it preserves everything);
* `f` is positive, obeys `f (x+1) = x f x`, and `f 1 = 1`;
* `ratio_periodic`: **any** solution of the functional equation is `Γ` times a `1`-periodic function
  — the solution space is huge, and only a shape hypothesis can pin down `Γ`;
* `f_ne_Gamma`: `fᵥ ≠ Γ` (already at `x = 1/2`);
* `not_logConvex`: `fᵥ` is not log-convex (else Mathlib's `Real.eq_Gamma_of_log_convex` would force
  `fᵥ = Γ`);
* `convex_hypothesis_insufficient`: the Lean-checkable core, bundling all of the above.

The one ingredient that is **not** machine-checked is the convexity of `fᵥ` itself: it needs
lower bounds on the tri/di-gamma functions (`(log Γ)''(x) ≥ 1/x` and `(log Γ)'(x) → ∞`) that current
Mathlib does not provide. That step is proved on paper and confirmed numerically in the note.

-- ANCHOR: bmc-perturb
/-- The `1`-periodic factor `1 + ε (1 - cos 2πx)`. It is `≥ 1`, so positive for `ε ≥ 0`; it equals
`1` at every integer; and it has period `1`. Multiplying `Γ` by it therefore keeps positivity, the
functional equation `f (x+1) = x f x`, and the normalization `f 1 = 1`. -/

and only a *shape* hypothesis (log-convexity, or — the question here — convexity) can hope to
single out `Γ`. -/

/-- **`fᵥ` is not log-convex.** If `log ∘ fᵥ` were convex on `(0, ∞)`, then the log-convex
Bohr–Mollerup theorem `Real.eq_Gamma_of_log_convex` — whose other hypotheses (positivity, the
functional equation, `fᵥ 1 = 1`) we have verified — would force `fᵥ = Γ` on `(0, ∞)`, contradicting
`f_ne_Gamma`. So `fᵥ` lies strictly *below* log-convexity. Together with the convexity of `fᵥ`
(proved analytically in the note), this is exactly why convexity is too weak to characterize `Γ`. -/

/-! ### The Lean-checkable core -/

-- ANCHOR: bmc-summary
/-- **Convexity is not sufficient (the machine-checked core).** For every `ε > 0`, `fᵥ` is a
positive solution of the Gamma functional equation with `fᵥ 1 = 1` that is **not** equal to `Γ` and
is **not** log-convex. The note proves analytically (and confirms numerically) that for small `ε`
(e.g. `ε = 1/100`) it is moreover **convex** — so, unlike log-convexity, plain convexity does not
determine `Γ`. -/
